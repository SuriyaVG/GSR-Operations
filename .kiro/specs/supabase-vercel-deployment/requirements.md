# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the GSR Operations application from its current mock database implementation to a production-ready hosting setup using Supabase as the backend database and authentication provider, and Vercel for frontend deployment. The migration will maintain all existing functionality while providing a scalable, cloud-hosted solution.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want the application hosted on reliable cloud infrastructure, so that it's accessible 24/7 with minimal downtime and automatic scaling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed THEN it SHALL be accessible via a custom domain on Vercel
2. WHEN users access the application THEN it SHALL load within 3 seconds on average
3. WHEN traffic increases THEN Vercel SHALL automatically scale the frontend hosting
4. IF deployment fails THEN the system SHALL maintain the previous working version

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to replace the mock database with Supabase, so that data persists reliably and the application can handle real production workloads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is saved THEN it SHALL persist in Supabase PostgreSQL database
2. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL connect to Supabase instead of mock database
3. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages
4. IF connection is lost THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect automatically

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want secure authentication through Supabase, so that my account and business data are protected with industry-standard security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users log in THEN authentication SHALL be handled by Supabase Auth
2. WHEN users register THEN their credentials SHALL be securely stored in Supabase
3. WHEN sessions expire THEN users SHALL be redirected to login automatically
4. IF authentication fails THEN users SHALL receive clear error messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want database migrations for all existing entities, so that the current data structure is preserved in the new Supabase setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrations run THEN all existing entities SHALL be created in Supabase
2. WHEN the application queries data THEN it SHALL use the same entity structure
3. WHEN relationships exist between entities THEN foreign keys SHALL be properly configured
4. IF migration fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error logs

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want environment-based configuration, so that I can have separate development, staging, and production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to different environments THEN each SHALL use separate Supabase projects
2. WHEN environment variables change THEN the application SHALL use the correct configuration
3. WHEN in development mode THEN it SHALL connect to development Supabase instance
4. IF environment configuration is missing THEN the application SHALL fail gracefully with clear errors

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated deployment pipelines, so that code changes are automatically deployed when merged to main branch.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to main branch THEN Vercel SHALL automatically deploy the application
2. WHEN deployment succeeds THEN the new version SHALL be live immediately
3. WHEN tests fail THEN deployment SHALL be blocked automatically
4. IF deployment fails THEN the previous version SHALL remain active

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want all existing functionality to work identically, so that the hosting migration doesn't disrupt my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using any existing feature THEN it SHALL work exactly as before
2. WHEN viewing data THEN all existing records SHALL be accessible
3. WHEN performing operations THEN response times SHALL be comparable or better
4. IF any feature breaks THEN it SHALL be identified and fixed before go-live
