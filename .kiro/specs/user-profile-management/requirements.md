# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables comprehensive user profile and role management within the GSR Operations system. It allows administrators to manage user profiles, update roles, set custom designations, and configure special user privileges. The system will support both self-service profile updates and administrative user management capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to update my profile information, so that my display name and personal details are current and accurate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses their profile settings THEN the system SHALL display current profile information including name, email, and role
2. WHEN a user updates their name THEN the system SHALL save the changes and update the display throughout the application
3. WHEN a user submits profile changes THEN the system SHALL validate the input and provide feedback on success or failure
4. WHEN profile updates are saved THEN the system SHALL immediately reflect changes in the sidebar and navigation areas

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to manage user roles and permissions, so that I can control access levels and maintain system security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator accesses user management THEN the system SHALL display a list of all users with their current roles
2. WHEN an administrator changes a user's role THEN the system SHALL update the user's permissions immediately
3. WHEN a role change is made THEN the system SHALL log the change with timestamp and administrator details
4. WHEN a user's role is changed THEN the system SHALL notify the affected user of the change
5. IF a user is currently logged in AND their role is changed THEN the system SHALL update their session permissions without requiring re-login

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to set custom designations and special configurations for specific users, so that key personnel have appropriate titles and access levels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator configures a user profile THEN the system SHALL allow setting custom designation titles (e.g., "CEO", "Manager", "Supervisor")
2. WHEN a specific email (suriyavg834@gmail.com) is detected THEN the system SHALL automatically apply predefined settings (name: "Suriya", designation: "CEO", role: "admin")
3. WHEN custom designations are set THEN the system SHALL display them in the user interface instead of generic role names
4. WHEN special user configurations are applied THEN the system SHALL maintain these settings across sessions and system restarts

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to have a user management interface, so that I can efficiently manage all user accounts from a central location.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator accesses the user management page THEN the system SHALL display a searchable and filterable list of users
2. WHEN viewing user details THEN the system SHALL show user activity, last login, and current permissions
3. WHEN managing users THEN the system SHALL provide bulk actions for role changes and user status updates
4. WHEN user changes are made THEN the system SHALL provide confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want user profile changes to be secure and auditable, so that I can maintain system integrity and compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any user profile change is made THEN the system SHALL create an audit log entry
2. WHEN role changes are performed THEN the system SHALL require administrator authentication
3. WHEN sensitive operations are performed THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting and validation
4. WHEN audit logs are accessed THEN the system SHALL provide filtering and export capabilities
