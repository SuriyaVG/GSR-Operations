# Data Integrity and Transaction Atomicity Implementation

This document summarizes the implementation of data integrity checks and atomic transaction functionality for the GSR Operations system.

## 1. Atomic Transaction Implementation

### 1.1 Database Functions

Two key database functions were implemented to ensure atomic transactions:

1. **`create_order_with_invoice`** - Ensures that orders and invoices are created together atomically
   - Located in `database/supabase/migrations/20250119000002_create_order_with_invoice_function.sql`
   - Handles validation, order creation, invoice creation, and financial ledger entry creation in a single transaction
   - Automatically rolls back all changes if any part of the process fails

2. **`create_production_batch_atomic`** - Ensures production batch creation and inventory decrements happen atomically
   - Located in `database/supabase/migrations/20250119000003_create_production_batch_atomic_function.sql`
   - Validates inventory availability, creates production batch, decrements inventory, and creates batch inputs in a single transaction
   - Automatically rolls back all changes if any part of the process fails

### 1.2 Service Layer Integration

The service layer was updated to use these atomic functions:

1. **OrderService** (`src/lib/orderService.ts`)
   - Uses `create_order_with_invoice` function to ensure atomicity
   - Handles inventory operations after successful order/invoice creation
   - Provides comprehensive error handling and rollback functionality

2. **ProductionBatchService** (`src/lib/productionBatch.ts`)
   - Uses `create_production_batch_atomic` function to ensure atomicity
   - Validates inventory before attempting batch creation
   - Provides manual rollback functionality for handling edge cases

### 1.3 Testing

Comprehensive tests were implemented to verify transaction integrity:

1. **Unit Tests** (`src/lib/__tests__/atomic-transactions.test.ts`)
   - Tests order/invoice creation atomicity
   - Tests production batch/inventory atomicity
   - Verifies rollback functionality when operations fail

2. **Integration Tests** (`src/lib/__tests__/transaction-integrity.test.ts`)
   - Tests end-to-end transaction flows
   - Verifies data consistency between related entities
   - Tests concurrent operation handling

3. **Database Function Tests** (`scripts/test-atomic-transactions.js`)
   - Directly tests database functions
   - Verifies validation, constraints, and rollback functionality
   - Checks for orphaned records after failed operations

## 2. Data Integrity Monitoring

### 2.1 Database Schema

A new table and supporting functions were added to track data integrity issues:

1. **`data_integrity_issues` Table**
   - Located in `database/supabase/migrations/20250119000006_data_integrity_monitoring.sql`
   - Tracks issue type, description, severity, affected entity, and resolution status
   - Includes RLS policies for secure access

2. **Database Check Functions**
   - `check_orphaned_orders()` - Finds orders without invoices
   - `check_orphaned_invoices()` - Finds invoices without valid orders
   - `check_orphaned_production_batches()` - Finds production batches without inputs
   - `check_negative_inventory()` - Finds inventory records with negative quantities
   - `check_financial_ledger_inconsistencies()` - Finds ledger inconsistencies
   - `run_data_integrity_checks()` - Comprehensive check that runs all individual checks

### 2.2 Service Layer

A new service was implemented to handle data integrity checks:

1. **DataIntegrityService** (`src/lib/services/dataIntegrityService.ts`)
   - Provides methods to check for various data integrity issues
   - Logs issues to the database for tracking
   - Allows resolving issues with resolution notes
   - Provides history tracking for resolved issues

### 2.3 UI Components

A new admin component was created to visualize and manage data integrity issues:

1. **DataIntegrityMonitor** (`src/Components/admin/DataIntegrityMonitor.tsx`)
   - Displays active data integrity issues
   - Allows running manual integrity checks
   - Provides interface for resolving issues
   - Shows history of resolved issues

### 2.4 Testing

Tests were implemented to verify data integrity monitoring functionality:

1. **Service Tests** (`src/lib/services/__tests__/dataIntegrityService.test.ts`)
   - Tests issue detection methods
   - Tests issue resolution functionality
   - Verifies error handling

## 3. Data Repair Utilities

Scripts were created to help repair data integrity issues:

1. **Check Script** (`scripts/check-data-integrity.js`)
   - Identifies various types of data integrity issues
   - Provides detailed reports on found issues
   - Can be run manually or scheduled as a cron job

2. **Repair Script** (`scripts/repair-data-integrity.js`)
   - Fixes orphaned orders by creating missing invoices
   - Fixes orphaned invoices by deleting them or creating missing orders
   - Fixes orphaned production batches
   - Fixes inventory inconsistencies
   - Fixes financial ledger inconsistencies

## 4. Implementation Benefits

This implementation provides several key benefits:

1. **Data Consistency** - Ensures related records are created or updated together
2. **Error Prevention** - Prevents partial operations that could leave the database in an inconsistent state
3. **Monitoring** - Provides tools to detect and track data integrity issues
4. **Repair** - Includes utilities to fix data integrity issues when they occur
5. **Audit Trail** - Tracks all data integrity issues and their resolutions

## 5. Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements to consider:

1. **Automated Monitoring** - Schedule regular integrity checks
2. **Alerting** - Send notifications when critical issues are detected
3. **Self-Healing** - Implement automatic repair for common issues
4. **Performance Optimization** - Optimize checks for large datasets
5. **Additional Checks** - Add more specialized integrity checks for business rules
