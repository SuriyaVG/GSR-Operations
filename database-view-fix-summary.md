# Database View Logic Correction Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes made to fix the database view logic issues identified in the audit. The fixes address calculation errors in `vw_batch_yield` and `vw_customer_metrics` views, and add proper error handling for edge cases.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed vw_batch_yield View

The `vw_batch_yield` view was updated to:
- Calculate `cost_per_litre` and `yield_percentage` within the view instead of using stored values
- Add proper NULL handling and division by zero protection
- Improve material breakdown calculations with proper aggregation
- Add efficiency rating based on yield percentage
- Include additional calculated metrics for better analysis

### 2. Fixed vw_customer_metrics View

The `vw_customer_metrics` view was updated to:
- Simplify the predicted reorder date calculation algorithm
- Add proper handling for customers with single orders (using 30-day default)
- Include NULL value handling for edge cases
- Add additional customer segmentation fields (value segment, reorder likelihood)
- Improve activity status logic with more granular categories

### 3. Added Error Handling in Application Code

A new `database-view-handler.ts` module was created to:
- Provide error handling for database view queries
- Implement fallback calculations when views are unavailable
- Ensure consistent data structure regardless of view availability
- Add proper error messages and logging

### 4. Updated Application Components

The following components were updated to use the new error-handling functions:
- `Production.tsx`: Now uses `getBatchYieldData()` with fallback calculations
- `Dashboard.tsx`: Now uses both `getBatchYieldData()` and `getCustomerMetricsData()`

## Testing

A test script (`test-view-error-handling.js`) was created to verify:
- View accessibility through the Supabase client
- Direct table access for fallback calculations
- Error handling behavior

## SQL Migration

A SQL migration file (`20250119000004_fix_database_views.sql`) was created with the corrected view definitions. This migration:
- Updates the views with proper calculated fields
- Adds indexes for improved view performance
- Includes documentation comments for future reference

## Benefits

These changes provide several benefits:
- More accurate yield and cost calculations
- Better handling of edge cases (NULL values, division by zero)
- Improved customer segmentation and reorder prediction
- Graceful degradation when views are unavailable
- Better error messages for troubleshooting

## Next Steps

1. Monitor the application for any issues related to the view calculations
2. Consider adding more comprehensive unit tests for the fallback calculations
3. Evaluate performance impact of the new view calculations and optimize if needed
