# RLS Policy Enforcement Test Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the results of comprehensive testing of Row Level Security (RLS) policy enforcement in the GSR Operations system. The tests verify that database-level security is functioning correctly with the corrected role assignments, ensuring users can only access data appropriate to their role.

## Test Coverage

The following tests were executed to verify RLS policy enforcement:

1. **Unit Tests**: Verified RLS helper functions and table access control
2. **Integration Tests**: Tested role-based access patterns across all user roles
3. **E2E Tests**: Validated RLS policies in real application flows
4. **Script-based Validation**: Ran comprehensive validation scripts against the database

## Test Results

### 1. Database Function Tests

| Function | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| get_user_role | ✅ PASS | Returns correct role from database |
| is_admin | ✅ PASS | Correctly identifies admin users |
| has_role | ✅ PASS | Validates specific role membership |
| has_any_role | ✅ PASS | Validates membership in role list |

### 2. Table Access Control Tests

| Table | Operation | Admin | Production | Sales | Finance | Viewer |
|-------|-----------|-------|------------|-------|---------|--------|
| user_profiles | SELECT | ✅ | ⚠️* | ⚠️* | ⚠️* | ⚠️* |
| orders | SELECT | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| orders | INSERT | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| customers | SELECT | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| customers | INSERT | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| production_batches | SELECT | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| production_batches | INSERT | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| financial_ledger | SELECT | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| financial_ledger | INSERT | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| invoices | SELECT | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| invoices | INSERT | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |

*Note: Non-admin users can only view their own profile

### 3. Role-Based Access Patterns

All five user roles were tested with the following results:

#### Admin Role
- ✅ Full access to all tables and operations
- ✅ Can view and modify all user profiles
- ✅ Can perform all financial operations
- ✅ Can manage production batches
- ✅ Can manage customers and orders

#### Production Role
- ✅ Can view orders, customers, and invoices
- ✅ Can create and manage production batches
- ✅ Cannot access financial ledger
- ✅ Cannot create orders or customers
- ✅ Can only view own user profile

#### Sales Manager Role
- ✅ Can view and create orders and customers
- ✅ Can view production batches but not create them
- ✅ Cannot access financial ledger
- ✅ Can create invoices
- ✅ Can only view own user profile

#### Finance Role
- ✅ Can view orders, customers, and production batches
- ✅ Can access financial ledger
- ✅ Can create and manage invoices
- ✅ Cannot create production batches
- ✅ Cannot create customers or orders
- ✅ Can only view own user profile

#### Viewer Role
- ✅ Can view orders, customers, production batches, and invoices
- ✅ Cannot create or modify any records
- ✅ Cannot access financial ledger
- ✅ Can only view own user profile

### 4. Cross-Role Access Prevention

- ✅ Production users cannot access financial data
- ✅ Finance users cannot create production batches
- ✅ Sales users cannot access financial ledger
- ✅ Viewer users cannot modify any data
- ✅ Non-admin users cannot view other user profiles

## Validation Script Results

The comprehensive RLS validation script was executed against the database and produced the following results:

- ✅ RLS helper functions are working correctly
- ✅ RLS is enabled on all critical tables
- ✅ User role assignments are correct in the database
- ✅ Role-based access control is functioning as expected
- ✅ RLS policies are effectively restricting access
- ✅ Role-specific operations are properly controlled

## Conclusion

The RLS policy enforcement tests confirm that:

1. Database-level security is functioning correctly with the corrected role assignments
2. Users can only access data appropriate to their role
3. RLS policies are properly enforced for all operations
4. The authentication system correctly assigns roles from the database

These results satisfy the requirements specified in the critical audit fixes:
- Requirement 7.2: RLS policies function with correct role assignments
- Requirement 7.4: Role assignments are based on database records
- Requirement 7.5: System passes role-based access control verification

## Next Steps

1. Continue monitoring RLS policy enforcement in production
2. Add security audit logging for unauthorized access attempts
3. Implement regular validation checks as part of system health monitoring
