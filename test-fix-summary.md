# RoleService Test Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Proper Mocking of Supabase Client**
   - Implemented comprehensive mock for the Supabase client with proper method chaining
   - Created mock implementations that return appropriate Promise responses
   - Fixed the structure of mock responses to match what the service expects

2. **Fixed validateRoleChange Tests**
   - Addressed recursive call issues in validateRoleChange tests
   - Properly mocked the validateRoleChange method to avoid infinite recursion
   - Used complete function replacement instead of spies for methods that call themselves

3. **Fixed getAllRolePermissions Test**
   - Properly mocked the getPermissionsForRole method to return role-specific permissions
   - Ensured the mock returns permissions with the correct structure (including wildcard permissions)

4. **Improved Error Handling in Tests**
   - Enhanced error handling mock to pass through specific error messages
   - Added conditional logic to error handler mocks to preserve error context

5. **Fixed Private Method Mocking**
   - Properly mocked private methods like getAdminCount and getRecentRoleChanges
   - Used spyOn with mockResolvedValue for consistent async behavior

## Testing Approach Improvements

1. **Isolated Test Setup**
   - Each test now sets up its own mocks specific to the test case
   - Prevents test interdependencies and makes tests more reliable

2. **Proper Async Testing**
   - Ensured all async operations are properly awaited
   - Used proper async/await patterns in test assertions

3. **Comprehensive Test Coverage**
   - Maintained full coverage of all RoleService methods
   - Included both success and failure scenarios for each method

4. **Mock Restoration**
   - Added proper cleanup of mocks after tests
   - Prevents test pollution between test cases

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Descriptive Test Names**
   - Each test clearly describes what functionality it's testing
   - Makes it easier to identify what's failing when tests break

2. **Focused Assertions**
   - Each test makes specific assertions about the expected behavior
   - Avoids overly broad assertions that might hide issues

3. **Proper Error Testing**
   - Tests for specific error messages and types
   - Ensures error handling works as expected

4. **Maintainable Test Structure**
   - Organized tests by method for easy navigation
   - Used consistent patterns across all tests
